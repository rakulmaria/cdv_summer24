			<p><b>The weather of the Faroe Islands</b>, is a creative data visualisation that seeks to show its viewers that a weather forecast can be translated into so much more than just numbers and statistics. </p>

			<p>The data visualisation uses weather reports of the Faroe Islands from the year of <b>1973</b> - <b>2001</b> to create a colorful and creative poster-like visualisation. Each visualisation of a year contains the annual percipation, average annual temperature, number of days with storm, hail, snow and fog. Each of the different datapoints are translated into different shapes with different colours.</p>
			
			<p>The visualisation seeks to inspire the viewer and show that a weather report can be so much more than just numbers and statistics; it can be translated into art.</p>

			<p>The visualisation was developed as a part of the final exam at the summer course, <a href="https://learnit.itu.dk/local/coursebase/view.php?ciid=1425">Creative Data Visualisation</a>, taught by <a href="https://annelieberner.com">Annelie Berner</a> at the <a href="https://itu.dk">IT University of Copenhagen</a>.</p>
